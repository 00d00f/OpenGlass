# OpenGlass
A replica of the dead software glass8, also known as the upstream project of [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass).  
This software is designed for Windows 10 2004 to Windows 11 23H2, which is currently in its early stages and may have various efficiency issues and bugs.   
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This software is intended for advanced users only. If you are a beginner and you do not have deeper knowledge of Windows (such as registry editing etc.) you should not install this software.  
> For the average users, you should consider using [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass).

> [!WARNING]   
> OpenGlass does NOT support and is NOT intended to support Windows Insider Preview, so if you want to use it in these Windows versions please do it at your own risk.


## Migrate from glass8 to OpenGlass
The following table demonstrates the similarities and differences between these two software.
> [!NOTE]
> 1. Most of the OpenGlass settings are stored only in the `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\DWM`, all registry items stored in HKLM remain constant at runtime.
> 2. All external resources referenced by OpenGlass must ensure that it can be accessed by DWM, so paths like `C:\Users\*` are invalid.
> 3. Instead of reading the registry directly to get the color, OpenGlass uses the udwm internal API to get the calculated color.

## How to reload the configuration
OpenGlass does not provide any GUI nor commands to explicitly reload the configuration, you may consider using glass8's heritage `AeroGlassGUI.exe` to refresh some of the settings.   
However, it's actually quite easy to do so in C/C++.
```c++
PostMessage(FindWindow(TEXT("Dwm"), nullptr), WM_THEMECHANGED, 0, 0);            // refresh part of the settings related to theme
PostMessage(FindWindow(TEXT("Dwm"), nullptr), WM_DWMCOLORIZATIONCHANGED, 0, 0);  // refresh part of the settings related to color/backdrop
```
