# OpenGlass
A replica of the dead software glass8, also known as the upstream project of [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass).  

> [!NOTE]
> This project currently maintains two branches
> - [master](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/tree/master) It has many features and relatively fewer bugs, but the performance is average. It depends on `dcomp` and `Windows.UI.Composition`.
> - [legacy](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/tree/legacy) It has few features, but its performance is much better than the master branch. It is implemented in a similar way to glass8.  
> 
> I don't have that much time to maintain both branches at the same time, so they may rarely get updated, but feel free to submit PRs.

This branch is designed for Windows 10 2004 to Windows 11 23H2. It works with Windows 10 1809 at a minimum, but I highly recommend you to use Windows 10 22H2.  

Some simple tests show that at lower blur radius this branch performs slightly worse than glass8, but at higher blur radius the performance will be a bit better. For some applications where `DwmEnableBlurBehind` and `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea` are used in combination, this branch performs almost twice as well as glass8.   
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This software is intended for advanced users only. If you are a beginner and you do not have deeper knowledge of Windows (such as registry editing etc.) you should not install this software.  
> For the average users, you should consider using [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass).

> [!WARNING]   
> OpenGlass does NOT support and is NOT intended to support Windows Insider Preview, so if you want to use it in these Windows versions please do it at your own risk.
## How to use this software
1. Extract the files from the Release page to `C:\`, but please don't put them in `C:\Users\*`, otherwise OpenGlass won't work properly.
2. Run `install.bat` as administrator, this will create a scheduled task for you to run the OpenGlass helper process on boot, which will monitor and automatically inject its component into Dwm.
3. Run `startup.bat` as administrator, this will run the helper process manually.
4. When you use it for the first time or just after updating your system, OpenGlass will try to download the symbol files and you will see its download progress bar in the taskbar, but please don't close it and be patient for about 15s. When the symbol files are ready, enjoy!
5. When you want to stop using OpenGlass or update the version of OpenGlass, running `shutdown.bat` will remove the effects of OpenGlass for you and exit the helper process. At this time, you can either replace the OpenGlass files or continue to run `uninstall.bat` and manually delete the remaining files to complete the uninstallation.

## Documentation (Migrate from glass8 to OpenGlass)
The following table demonstrates the similarities and differences between these two software.
> [!NOTE]
> 1. Most of the OpenGlass settings are stored in the `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\DWM` and `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\DWM`, but some registry items are stored only in HKLM and will remain constant at runtime.
> 2. All external resources referenced by OpenGlass must ensure that it can be accessed by DWM, so paths like `C:\Users\*` are invalid.
> 3. Normally, OpenGlass uses the udwm internal API to get the calculated color instead of reading the registry directly to get the color.

- `Not implemented` means that this feature has not yet been implemented but is possible in the future.
- `Not supported` means that this feature is impossible to be implemented in current structure.

## How to reload the configuration
OpenGlass does not provide any GUI nor commands to explicitly reload the configuration, you may consider using glass8's heritage `AeroGlassGUI.exe` to refresh some of the settings.   
However, it's actually quite easy to do so in C/C++.
```c++
PostMessage(FindWindow(TEXT("Dwm"), nullptr), WM_THEMECHANGED, 0, 0);            // refresh part of the settings related to theme
PostMessage(FindWindow(TEXT("Dwm"), nullptr), WM_DWMCOLORIZATIONCHANGED, 0, 0);  // refresh part of the settings related to color/backdrop
```

## About compatibility
- OpenGlass cannot be used with DWMBlurGlass as they belong to the same type of software.
- OpenGlass does not support rendering borders that are included in accents, so some softwares that turn on borders for accents such as TranslucentFlyouts will not be able to display borders.
- OpenGlass can be used with [AWM](https://github.com/Dulappy/aero-window-manager), but `CustomThemeMsstyle` will not be available and you need to be careful about the order in which you execute and stop.
    - **Good ExampleðŸ˜˜**:  

        execute OpenGlass  
        execute AWM  
        ...  
        stop AWM  
        stop OpenGlass  

        (The first to execute should be stopped at last.)
    - **Bad ExampleðŸ˜­**:  
        execute OpenGlass  
        execute AWM  
        ...  
        stop OpenGlass  
        stop AWM  

        In this case you are likely to get a crash of DWM or the other software working abnormally.
- OpenGlass can be used with most windhawk mods, but some may have compatibility issues, especially community or personally written mods that can't be found in the windhawk marketplace.
- It is not necessary to use the DComp Unlocker mod with OpenGlass, as OpenGlass already has this feature built-in.
